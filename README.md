# Thyroid Cancer Risk Prediction

Predicting the risk of thyroid cancer using machine learning models trained on clinical and diagnostic data.

---

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on building a reliable and interpretable model to assess thyroid cancer risk. Leveraging patient data, the pipeline includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to assist in early diagnosis.

##  Key Features

- Comprehensive data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization)
- Advanced feature selection techniques to identify key predictors
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- Rigorous evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Visualizations for feature importance and model performance
- Modular codebase for easy experimentation and extension
